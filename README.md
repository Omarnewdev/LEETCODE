## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).

This project is making to know how is my learning in problem solutions I make this with the aim of seeing my progress.
The majory of the project is my trying to solve the exercise, sometimes you will see the code is a total crap, the English or both
but I doing this to show that with persistents and passion you can solve very difficult problems.

If you have a suggestion make your pull request will see you when we finish 100 exercises with a new message
